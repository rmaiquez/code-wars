# There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
# But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.
# You got an array with your colleges' points. Now calculate the average to your points!

# Return True if you're better, else False!

# Note:
# Your points are not included in the array of your classes points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

# My Solution:

def better_than_average(class_points, your_points):
    class_points.append(your_points)
    average_class = sum(class_points) // len(class_points)
    if your_points > average_class:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Clever Solution:

def better_than_average(class_points, your_points):
    return your_points > sum(class_points) / len(class_points)
